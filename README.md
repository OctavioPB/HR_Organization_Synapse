# Organizational Synapse & Knowledge Risk

A graph-based HR intelligence platform that analyzes collaboration metadata to detect knowledge silos, identify single points of failure, quantify organizational risk, and generate executive briefings — before HR has any subjective signal.

---

## What it does

The system ingests collaboration metadata (Slack, Teams, Jira, GitHub, Confluence, Notion) as a stream of directed edges — who interacted with whom, on which channel, at what time — and builds a live organizational network graph. From that graph it computes structural metrics per employee, runs daily and weekly ML pipelines, and surfaces the results through a REST API, an interactive React dashboard, and a natural language query interface powered by Claude.

**Core outputs:**

| Output | Description |
|---|---|
| **SPOF score** | Single-point-of-failure risk derived from betweenness centrality, cross-department bridging, clustering coefficient, and entropy trend |
| **Knowledge risk** | Sole-expert fraction, document volume, and domain breadth combined with SPOF to produce an enhanced risk score |
| **Silo alerts** | Communities whose internal/external edge ratio exceeds threshold (Louvain detection) |
| **Anomaly alerts** | Employees whose connectivity pattern deviates from their 30-day baseline (Isolation Forest) |
| **Churn risk** | GNN-based churn probability with `low / medium / high / critical` tiers |
| **Succession plans** | Top-N candidates for each critical SPOF employee, ranked by structural, clustering, and domain compatibility |
| **Org health score** | Composite 0–100 score with weekly trend and AI-generated executive briefing |
| **What-If simulation** | Recalculates graph health after removing a single employee; shows cross-department connectivity loss %, average path length increase, and direct links severed |
| **NL query interface** | Ask questions in plain English — a Claude agentic loop calls graph and risk tools and returns a grounded answer |
| **Compliance reports** | GDPR/CCPA data audit, Article 20 export, consent management, retention purge, quarterly HTML report |

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Docker + Docker Compose
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+

### 1. Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Required for NL query and org health briefings:
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

### 2. Start infrastructure

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| Airflow UI | http://localhost:8088 (admin / admin) |
| Adminer (DB) | http://localhost:8081 |
| Grafana | http://localhost:3001 (admin / `GRAFANA_PASSWORD`) |
| Kafka | localhost:9092 |
| PostgreSQL | localhost:5432 |
| Neo4j | http://localhost:7474 (optional) |

### 3. Generate synthetic data

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python data/synthetic/generate_org_data.py --employees 120 --days 60
```

### 4. Seed the graph

```bash
# Trigger via Airflow UI, or directly:
airflow dags trigger graph_builder_dag
```

### 5. Start the API

```bash
uvicorn api.main:app --reload --port 8000
# Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### 6. Start the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# Dashboard: http://localhost:5173
```

## SPOF score formula

```
SPOF_score = α × betweenness_centrality
           + β × cross_department_edge_ratio
           + γ × (1 − clustering_coefficient)
           − δ × entropy_trend
```

Weights are configurable via environment variables (`SPOF_ALPHA`, `SPOF_BETA`, `SPOF_GAMMA`, `SPOF_DELTA`). Scores are bucketed: `normal` (< 0.4), `warning` (0.4–0.7), `critical` (> 0.7).

**Enhanced SPOF** (F3): `(1 − δ) × graph_spof + δ × knowledge_score` where `knowledge_score` incorporates sole-expert fraction, document volume, and domain breadth.

---

## Org health score (F9)

```
composite_risk = 0.20 × silo_risk
              + 0.35 × spof_risk
              + 0.20 × entropy_risk
              + 0.25 × fragmentation_risk

health_score = (1 − composite_risk) × 100   [clamped 0–100]
```

Tiers: `healthy` (≥ 80) · `caution` (60–79) · `at_risk` (40–59) · `critical` (< 40).

A weekly executive briefing is generated every Monday at 06:00 UTC, with a Claude-authored narrative if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set (template fallback otherwise). Delivery via Slack or SendGrid is opt-in via environment variables.

## Multi-tenant SaaS mode (F6)

Each tenant gets an isolated PostgreSQL schema (`tenant_{slug}`) provisioned on sign-up. The `search_path` is switched per-request based on `X-Tenant-ID` + `X-Api-Key` headers.

```bash
# Provision a tenant (admin key required)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/admin/tenants \
  -H "X-Admin-Key: $ADMIN_SECRET_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"slug": "acme-corp", "name": "Acme Corp", "plan": "pro"}'
# → returns raw_api_key (shown once, not stored)

# Authenticate as a tenant
curl http://localhost:8000/risk/scores \
  -H "X-Tenant-ID: <tenant-uuid>" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: <raw-api-key>"
```

Kafka topics are namespaced per-tenant: `{slug}.collaboration.events.raw`.

---

## Natural language query (F7)

Send a plain-English question to `POST /query/natural`. A Claude agentic loop resolves it using graph and risk tools (up to 6 reasoning turns), returning a grounded answer with tool call transparency.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query/natural \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "Who are the top 3 SPOF risks in Engineering and why?"}'
```

Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the environment.

---

## Compliance & privacy (F8)

1. **Metadata only.** No message content, email bodies, or file contents are ever ingested — only `{who} → {whom}`, `{channel}`, `{timestamp}`.
2. **Consent-gated computation.** The `employees.consent` column is enforced in every graph query: employees who opt out are excluded from all graph computations, risk scores, and analytics.
3. **Data retention.** `raw_events` are automatically purged after 90 days; `graph_snapshots` after 365 days. Each purge run is recorded in `data_retention_purges` for audit.
4. **GDPR Article 20.** `GET /compliance/data-export/{id}` returns a complete personal data package (raw events, graph snapshots, risk scores, knowledge entries, consent audit log).
5. **Consent audit trail.** Every consent change is recorded in `consent_audit_log` with timestamp, actor, and reason.
6. **Aggregate alerts.** Risk signals target organizational patterns — "Engineering ↔ Sales bridge is at risk" — not individuals under surveillance.

---

## Running tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v --tb=short

# Subsets
pytest tests/unit/test_graph_metrics.py -v
pytest tests/unit/test_compliance.py -v
pytest tests/unit/test_tenant.py -v
pytest tests/unit/test_nl_query.py -v
pytest tests/unit/test_org_health.py -v
```

All unit tests mock the database entirely via `dependency_overrides` and `unittest.mock.patch` — no live DB or Kafka required.

---

## Demo scenario

```bash
python data/synthetic/generate_org_data.py --employees 120 --days 60
```

Expected outcomes:
- **SPOF scores:** both bridge employees surface in top 5; gap vs normal employees is large because only 8% of normal interactions cross department boundaries, making connectors the primary cross-dept bridges
- **Silo alerts:** HR and Sales departments fire silo alerts (isolation ratio > 2.5×); Engineering does not
- **Withdrawing employee:** enters `critical` flag in the final 15 days of the window as entropy trend declines
- **What-If (removing a connector):** ~30–50% of all cross-department edges disappear; average path length between colleagues increases by 1–3 hops
- **NL query:** "Who are the critical connectors between Engineering and Sales?" returns a grounded, tool-backed answer
